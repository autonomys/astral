## Prerequisites

- node 16.x
- docker
- npm -- note that `yarn` package manager is not supported

## Quickly running the squid

Commands below use [sqd](https://docs.subsquid.io/squid-cli/).
Please [install](https://docs.subsquid.io/squid-cli/installation/) it before proceeding.

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm ci

# 2. Start target Postgres database and detach
sqd up

# 3. Build the project
sqd build

# 4. Start both the squid processor and the GraphQL server
sqd run .
```

A GraphiQL playground will be available at [localhost:4350/graphql](http://localhost:4350/graphql).

## Dev flow

### 1. Define database schema

Start development by defining the schema of the target database via `schema.graphql`.
Schema definition consists of regular graphql type declarations annotated with custom directives.
Full description of `schema.graphql` dialect is available [here](https://docs.subsquid.io/store/postgres/schema-file/).

### 2. Generate TypeORM classes

Mapping developers use [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io) entities
to interact with the target database during data processing. All necessary entity classes are
[generated](https://docs.subsquid.io/store/postgres/schema-file/intro/) by the squid framework from `schema.graphql`. This is done by running `npx squid-typeorm-codegen`
or (equivalently) `sqd codegen` command.

### 3. Generate database migration

All database changes are applied through migration files located at `db/migrations`.
`squid-typeorm-migration(1)` tool provides several commands to drive the process.
It is all [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/#/migrations) under the hood.

```bash
# Connect to database, analyze its state and generate migration to match the target schema.
# The target schema is derived from entity classes generated earlier.
# Don't forget to compile your entity classes beforehand!
npx squid-typeorm-migration generate

# Create template file for custom database changes
npx squid-typeorm-migration create

# Apply database migrations from `db/migrations`
npx squid-typeorm-migration apply

# Revert the last performed migration
npx squid-typeorm-migration revert
```

Available `sqd` shortcuts:

```bash
# Build the project, remove any old migrations, then run `npx squid-typeorm-migration generate`
sqd migration:generate

# Run npx squid-typeorm-migration apply
sqd migration:apply
```

### 4. Generate TypeScript definitions for substrate events, calls and storage

This is an optional part, but it is very advisable.

Event, call and runtime storage data come to mapping handlers as raw untyped json.
While it is possible to work with raw untyped json data,
it's extremely error-prone and the json structure may change over time due to runtime upgrades.

Squid framework provides a tool for generating type-safe wrappers around events, calls and runtime storage items for
each historical change in the spec version. See the [Substrate typegen](https://docs.subsquid.io/substrate-indexing/squid-substrate-typegen/) documentation page.

## Deploy the Squid

After a local run, obtain a deployment key by signing into [Subsquid Cloud](https://app.subsquid.io) and run

```sh
npx sqd auth -k YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_KEY
```

Next, inspect the Squid CLI help to deploy and manage your squid:

```sh
npx sqd squid --help
```

For more information, consult the [Deployment Guide](https://docs.subsquid.io/deploy-squid/).

## Project conventions

Squid tools assume a certain project layout.

- All compiled js files must reside in `lib` and all TypeScript sources in `src`.
  The layout of `lib` must reflect `src`.
- All TypeORM classes must be exported by `src/model/index.ts` (`lib/model` module).
- Database schema must be defined in `schema.graphql`.
- Database migrations must reside in `db/migrations` and must be plain js files.
- `squid-*(1)` executables consult `.env` file for a number of environment variables.

See the [full desription](https://docs.subsquid.io/basics/squid-structure/) in the documentation.

## Types bundle

Substrate chains that have blocks with metadata versions below 14 don't provide enough
information to decode their data. For those chains, external [type](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api/start/types.extend) [definitions](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api/start/types.extend) are required.

Subsquid tools include definitions for many chains, however sometimes external
definitions are still required.

You can pass them as a special json file (types bundle) of the following structure:

```json5
{
  types: {
    AccountId: "[u8; 32]",
  },
  typesAlias: {
    assets: {
      Balance: "u64",
    },
  },
  versions: [
    {
      minmax: [0, 1000], // spec version range with inclusive boundaries
      types: {
        AccountId: "[u8; 16]",
      },
      typesAlias: {
        assets: {
          Balance: "u32",
        },
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

- `.types` - scale type definitions similar to [polkadot.js types](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api/start/types.extend#extension)
- `.typesAlias` - similar to [polkadot.js type aliases](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api/start/types.extend#type-clashes)
- `.versions` - per-block range overrides/patches for above fields.

All fields in the type bundle are optional and applied on top of a fixed set of well-known frame types.

Note, that although the structure of subsquid types bundle is very similar to the one from polkadot.js,
those two are not fully compatible.

## Differences from polkadot.js

Polkadot.js provides lots of [specialized classes](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api/start/types.basics) for various types of data.
Even primitives like `u32` are exposed through special classes.
In contrast, the squid framework works only with plain js primitives and objects.
For instance, account data is passed to the handler context as a plain byte array. To convert it into a standard human-readable format one should explicitly use a utility lib `@subsquid/ss58`:

```typescript
    // ...
    from: ss58.codec('kusama').encode(rec.from),
    to: ss58.codec('kusama').encode(rec.to),
```

## Graphql server extensions

It is possible to extend `squid-graphql-server(1)` with custom
[type-graphql](https://typegraphql.com) resolvers and to add request validation.
For more details, consult [docs](https://docs.subsquid.io/graphql-api/).
